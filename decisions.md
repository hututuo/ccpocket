# ccPocket Compatibility Decisions

## Upstream-compatible local fixes

- Local compatibility fixes must preserve the official protocol and data model wherever possible.
- Prefer narrow adapters and replaceable internal boundaries over broad rewrites.
- Every local behavior change needs regression coverage so official updates can be rebased and compared safely.
- Keep compatibility commits isolated by behavior; do not mix them with unrelated simulator, signing, or packaging work.
- For large session files, use bounded streaming or incremental reads. Do not restore whole-file JSONL loading merely to simplify an upstream merge.
- Sync official releases with an explicit merge commit after semantic review; retain a pre-sync safety branch and do not rewrite already validated compatibility commits by default.
- Resolve hotspot files from the latest official source plus the smallest necessary compatibility patch. Do not run whole-file formatters on large upstream-owned screens merely to resolve a small conflict.
