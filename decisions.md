# ccPocket Compatibility Decisions

## Upstream-compatible local fixes

- Local compatibility fixes must preserve the official protocol and data model wherever possible.
- Prefer narrow adapters and replaceable internal boundaries over broad rewrites.
- Every local behavior change needs regression coverage so official updates can be rebased and compared safely.
- Keep compatibility commits isolated by behavior; do not mix them with unrelated simulator, signing, or packaging work.
- For large session files, use bounded streaming or incremental reads. Do not restore whole-file JSONL loading merely to simplify an upstream merge.
- Sync official releases with an explicit merge commit after semantic review; retain a pre-sync safety branch and do not rewrite already validated compatibility commits by default.
- Resolve hotspot files from the latest official source plus the smallest necessary compatibility patch. Do not run whole-file formatters on large upstream-owned screens merely to resolve a small conflict.
- Embedded artifact previews are enabled only on iOS for now. Web, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux keep the existing external-browser fallback until each platform has a user-visible native save destination and a verified WebView security configuration.
- In embedded mode the Bridge renders preview content only; Flutter owns back navigation, share, download, hide/reveal, transfer cancellation, and file persistence. Do not add a broad JavaScript-to-native channel for artifact actions.
- On iOS, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and RTF use a narrow system Quick Look adapter. Reuse the authenticated, bounded artifact download into app-temporary storage; validate that the native path remains inside the app home directory; keep the file until the native dismissal callback; then remove it. Do not upload Office files to an external preview service or move this behavior into the Bridge protocol.
