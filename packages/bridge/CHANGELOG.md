# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ccpocket/bridge` will be documented in this file.

## [1.69.4-compat.2] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- Complete the mobile comprehensive-remediation stack and its independent review follow-up, including stricter browser-origin trust, restart-safe process guards, correlated Git image responses, official approval-policy inheritance, and atomic prompt-history mutations.

### Compatibility
- Keep native clients without a browser `Origin` compatible, preserve unambiguous legacy Git image responses, and add no required protocol or persisted-schema migration.

## [1.69.4-compat.1] - 2026-07-25

### Changed
- Integrate the official Bridge 1.69.4 session-link, image-restore, managed auto-review, and Codex app-server hardening changes while retaining the local bounded history, continuity, notification, mirror, file, and compatibility modules.

## [1.69.4] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Resolve external session links against live Bridge and provider IDs or the exact recent-session index entry, with correlated resume completion and scoped unavailable-history errors.

## [1.69.3] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Verify session restore lifecycle events consistently across Windows and POSIX Bridge environments.

## [1.69.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Keep image-heavy session restores alive with explicit progress and failure events, idempotent reconnect handling, and bounded restore timeouts.
- Reduce repeated history and image processing during session restore with reusable Codex history, content-addressed image references, and seven-day HTTP caching.

## [1.69.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Honor managed Codex auto-review restrictions when starting and resuming sessions, and expose the policy state to connected clients.
- Improve Codex app-server resilience around RPC errors, active-writer conflicts, archived threads, and streamed response recovery.

## [1.69.0-compat.6] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Allow full conversation mirrors above the former 10,000-entry ceiling while keeping transfer planning and Mobile storage checks linear.
- Send a bounded 200-entry canonical render window to opting-in Mobile clients without changing legacy client responses.

### Compatibility
- Keep complete downloaded history in the independent conversation mirror; Mobile retains every user-turn index row and loads distant 200-entry windows by stored ordinal.

## [1.69.0-compat.5] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Reuse the bounded Desktop tool descriptor in the live continuity stream, so Skill reads, semantic shell actions, and sub-agent lifecycle calls keep the same names while a Desktop turn is running and after canonical history reconciliation.

## [1.69.0-compat.4] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- Restore bounded recent Codex Desktop host-tool activity that app-server omits from canonical thread history, including skill reads, shell reads and searches, multi-command execution, image inspection, plans, goals, and the full sub-agent lifecycle.
- Preserve official Codex collaboration, sub-agent activity, context compaction, image view, and wait ThreadItems in both active history and on-device full-conversation synchronization.

### Fixed
- Merge Desktop-only tools at their actual turn and visible-message interval while de-duplicating equivalent official ThreadItems, so live history and downloaded history use one ordering model.
- Cache large rollout reads incrementally and cap supplemental events and output text to keep repeated mobile synchronization bounded.

### Compatibility
- Keep the supplement Bridge-owned and additive; Mobile `1.107.2+199` gains localized activity labels while older clients continue rendering unknown tool names through the existing fallback.

## [1.69.0-compat.1] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- Merge official Bridge 1.69.0 while preserving the local artifact, file-transfer, file-browser, session-mirror, Side Chat, Desktop-continuity, Fork-lineage, and Mobile-host capability modules.

## [1.69.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Emit structured Codex Guardian approval notices for medium- and high-risk auto-approved actions, with client capability negotiation and legacy history filtering.

## [1.68.2] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Preserve live Codex subagent tool logs before the final assistant response when canonical thread snapshots omit subagent activity, including compacted and multi-client history synchronization.

## [1.68.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Reduce Codex skill-completion latency by reusing provider- and working-directory-scoped completion metadata and fetching skills, apps, and plugins in parallel with skills prioritized.
- Log the elapsed time from session start until completion metadata becomes available.

### Fixed
- Propagate empty completion snapshots so removed skills, apps, and plugins do not remain cached.

## [1.68.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Support configuring the Codex model and reasoning effort used for session auto-rename and commit-message assistance, including persisted launchd and systemd service settings.

## [1.67.4-compat.4] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Expose the capability-gated, descriptor-confined Mac file browser used by the Mobile Files entry without changing the existing transfer protocol.
- Mirror additional durable Codex Desktop tool events, including command execution, MCP, file changes, web search, and bounded image-generation metadata.

### Fixed
- Bind Mobile session identity, status, model, effort, speed, and permission presets to the current WebSocket session list before accepting history fallbacks.
- Re-register Desktop continuity watches safely after reconnect and preserve canonical history reconciliation when a local mirror opens an active session.

### Compatibility
- Keep all additions capability-gated; older Mobile clients continue using chat and transfer, while newer clients fall back to session list/history on older Bridges.

## [1.67.4-compat.3] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Mirror Codex Desktop-owned turn state, reasoning, tool activity, and assistant messages from the durable rollout into connected mobile sessions.
- Preserve the existing one-item mobile queue during Desktop work, including edit, cancel, and exact-turn guidance when the active Desktop turn is unambiguous.

### Fixed
- Track overlapping and out-of-order Desktop turns independently so one terminal event cannot make another active turn appear idle.
- Refresh stale Codex runtime history under the same Bridge session ID before handing off queued mobile input, without destroying the previous runtime on bootstrap failure.

### Compatibility
- Negotiate Desktop continuity as an additive capability; new mobile clients stay silent on older Bridges and older mobile clients retain the previous behavior on this Bridge.

## [1.67.4-compat.2] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Rebase the compatibility build on official Bridge 1.67.4 while preserving the independently removable session, artifact, preview, and file-transfer modules.

### Fixed
- Include the official streamed-response finalization and same-turn history reconciliation fixes without collapsing distinct assistant responses.
## [1.67.4] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Preserve streamed Codex assistant responses when completion notifications are missing or delayed.
- Deduplicate canonical and live Codex history for the same user turn without collapsing distinct responses.

## [1.67.3-compat.2] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Rebase the compatibility build on official Bridge 1.67.3 while preserving automatic artifact links, generated-image recovery, and bounded streaming history reads.

### Fixed
- Replay cached Codex goal state with history responses so active goals remain visible after turn completion and app relaunch.

## [1.67.2-compat.2] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Rebase the compatibility build on official Bridge 1.67.2 while preserving automatic artifact links, generated-image recovery, and bounded streaming history reads.

### Added
- Detect high-confidence local links in completed Codex Markdown and attach stable artifact references without rewriting the original response.
- Preserve structured generated-image paths, stage trusted generated images in private managed storage, and restore the same references in session history.
- Resolve preview links on demand and authorize source-file reads through a dedicated request that is bound to the session, message, artifact identity, and current project roots.

### Changed
- Persist the artifact registry and automatic-artifact service settings so references survive Bridge restarts while short-lived preview capabilities are minted only when clicked.
- Keep live and replayed Codex messages on the same enrichment path, with bounded candidate and message sizes.
- Bind new Gallery entries to stable provider sessions and repair generated-image history without copying the same drawing again after each Bridge runtime restart.

### Security
- Revalidate canonical roots and file identity at click time, read source files through the same verified file handle, and reject changed, missing, symlink-escaped, oversized, or mismatched artifacts.
- Keep command output, diffs, code blocks, bare paths, directories, and arbitrary MCP fields outside automatic publication.

## [1.66.1-compat.1] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- Add `ccpocket-bridge share <path>` for short-lived, token-protected file links.
- Add responsive browser previews for images, PDFs, text, audio, video, and DOCX, with system-open and download fallbacks.
- Stream inline and attachment content with HEAD and single-range support.

### Security
- Restrict path publication to a loopback-only control route and canonical paths inside `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS`.
- Keep artifact capabilities in memory, omit source paths from URLs and responses, and isolate artifact routes from permissive CORS headers.
## [1.67.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Replay cached Codex goal state with history responses so active goals remain visible after turn completion and app relaunch.

## [1.67.2] - 2026-07-17

## [1.67.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Preserve Codex sandbox mode on session resume
- Restore Codex recent session settings correctly

## [1.25.0] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Prevent false auth error detection on long assistant messages containing auth-related keywords

## [1.24.0] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Claude usage tracking is now opt-in (set `BRIDGE_ENABLE_USAGE=1` to enable). No direct Anthropic API calls by default

## [1.23.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Add `gpt-5.4-mini` to available Codex model list
- Graceful degradation for unsupported Bridge message types with per-action client fallback handling

### Changed
- Doctor check no longer requires unused `codex-sdk`, and skips `systemd` checks on macOS

## [1.22.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- "Invalid message format" error when app sends `refresh_branch` message (missing parser case)

## [1.22.0] - 2026-03-17

## [1.20.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Gentle tip message when project has no git repository (persisted in session history)
- Categorized `errorCode` for git-related diff errors (`git_not_available`)

### Changed
- Non-git projects return empty file list instead of error on `list_files`
- Diff errors for non-git projects use user-friendly message instead of raw git error

## [1.19.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Add `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` (1M context) to available Claude model list

## [1.18.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Include `bridgeVersion` in `session_list` messages for client-side version checks

### Fixed
- Send skill descriptions from Claude Code `supportedCommands()` — previously only skill names were forwarded, causing the mobile app to display directory names instead of descriptions

### Changed
- Update `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to 0.2.74

## [1.17.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Sandbox configuration now delegated to Claude Code native `.claude/settings.json` — Bridge passes only `enabled: true/false`
- Worktree configuration uses `.gtrconfig` only (removed `.ccpocket.toml` priority logic)

### Removed
- `.ccpocket.toml` support and `smol-toml` dependency — sandbox settings should be configured via `.claude/settings.json`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Auto-enable `loginctl enable-linger` on systemd setup to keep the Bridge Server running after logout (SSH disconnect etc.)
  - Idempotent: skips if linger is already enabled

### Removed
- Unused `@openai/codex-sdk` dependency

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-12

- `checkSystemdService` in `doctor` command for Linux service health check
- Resolves full `npx` path at setup time so nvm/mise/volta-managed Node.js works under systemd

### Changed
- `setup` command now uses dynamic imports with `platform()` branching instead of static launchd import
- Unsupported platforms (e.g. Windows) get a clear error message

### Removed
- `claude auth login` feature removed (refactor: remove claude auth login feature)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Claude Code sandbox support — pass sandbox enabled/disabled state from mobile client to Claude SDK via `query()` options
- Claude sandbox mode toggle — changing sandbox restarts the session with the new setting (sandbox is a query-level config)
- `.ccpocket.toml` configuration file support with `[worktree]` section, prioritized over legacy `.gtrconfig`
- `smol-toml` dependency for TOML parsing

### Changed
- Simplified permission/sandbox mode forwarding — both Claude and Codex sessions now use unified message handling

## [1.14.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Codex Skills (Prompts) support — fetch full skill metadata (description, defaultPrompt, brandColor) via `skills/list` RPC and forward to Flutter client as `skillMetadata`
- Send `SkillUserInput` (`{ type: "skill", name, path }`) when a Codex skill is selected, enabling proper skill loading and execution
- Handle `skills/changed` notification for automatic skill re-fetching
- Cache skill metadata alongside slash commands for session restore

## [1.13.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Remove misleading WARNING log when BRIDGE_API_KEY is not set — API key authentication is optional (Tailscale handles security)

## [1.13.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Rewind session_created messages now include `sourceSessionId`, preventing duplicate session screens on restart and rewind
- Codex permission mode changes trigger a session restart (matching sandbox mode behavior) with confirmation dialog
- Codex session_created response now includes `permissionMode`, ensuring restored sessions retain their permission setting

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Claude OAuth authentication status endpoint — settings screen can display login state and trigger re-authentication without leaving the app (experimental)

### Fixed
- Usage API returning persistent 429 errors — refresh OAuth token on rate-limit responses (not just on 401), resolving stale-token rate limits
- Auth status check no longer probes the upstream API, eliminating redundant requests that could trigger rate limits when opening the settings screen

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- `errorCode` field on error messages for structured client-side display (`auth_login_required`, `auth_token_expired`, `auth_api_error`, `path_not_allowed`)

### Changed
- Auth and path-not-allowed error messages now include clear problem descriptions and remedy instructions (e.g. `claude auth login`) so users can self-resolve without checking server logs
- Dev script unsets `CLAUDECODE` env var to allow E2E testing inside a Claude Code session

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Fall back to macOS Keychain for Claude OAuth credentials when `~/.claude/.credentials.json` does not exist (e.g. login performed on older Claude Code version that stored creds in Keychain)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Deliver available model lists (Claude / Codex) in `session_list` message so clients can display dynamic dropdowns instead of hardcoded values

### Changed
- Update model lists to latest versions: Claude 4.6 series (opus, sonnet, haiku), Codex gpt-5.4 default

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Restore slash commands on `get_history` after history eviction — long sessions (100+ messages) lost `init`/`supported_commands` from in-memory history, causing slash completion to fall back to 4 built-in commands when re-entering the session
- Protect `system` messages from history eviction alongside `user_input`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS` environment variable for project path whitelist (defaults to `$HOME`)
- Path validation on `start`, `resume_session`, `get_diff`, `get_diff_image`, `list_files`, `list_worktrees`, `remove_worktree` — rejects paths outside allowed directories
- Include `allowedDirs` in `session_list` message for client-side path input assistance
- Send `project_history` on WebSocket connect so clients receive history immediately

## [1.9.7] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Auto-refresh expired OAuth access token before starting SDK session (prevents auth errors when token expires between CLI sessions)

## [1.9.6] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Skip system-injected messages (`<local-command-caveat>`, `<local-command-stderr>`, etc.) when extracting firstPrompt/lastPrompt from JSONL scan
- Add streaming fallback for sessions with large user messages (embedded images) that exceed the 16KB head-read buffer
- Supplement missing lastPrompt for Claude sessions via tail-read with growing window (8KB→128KB), enabling distinct Last display mode in session list (+3-5ms overhead)

## [1.9.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Replace `claude auth status` process spawn with lightweight file read for auth pre-check (reduces memory pressure)
- Preserve extra credential fields (scopes, subscriptionType, rateLimitTier) when refreshing OAuth tokens

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Read Claude OAuth credentials from disk (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) instead of macOS Keychain, eliminating iCloudHelper keychain dialog
- Replace keychain-based doctor check with file-based credential check

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Pre-check Claude auth before starting SDK session to prevent macOS keychain access dialog
- Remove password read (-w flag) from doctor's keychain check to avoid triggering keychain dialog
- Preserve original user text when merging SDK echo (avoid overwriting with translated text)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Include Claude Code model name in session list response (stored from system/init message)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Make Codex sandbox mode switching actually work (destroy + resume with new sandbox parameter)
- Fix 0-message session sandbox switch causing "no rollout found" error
- Always use last turn_context for codex session settings after sandbox mode changes
- Send sandbox mode in external format ("on"/"off") to clients instead of internal format

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Add timestamp to `user_input` history entries so client displays original send time
- Register uploaded images in imageStore and include image URLs in `user_input` history for session re-entry

- Optimize namedOnly session path to skip unnamed sessions early
- Parallelize Claude + Codex session loading with Promise.all
- Remove messageCount from session index entries to eliminate full-file scanning

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Stabilize busy-path queue handling by deriving `input_ack.queued` and interrupt behavior from actual enqueue results
- Ensure busy-path logs are emitted consistently when input is queued and interrupted
- Resolve tool-result image paths relative to project root when CLI outputs project-relative absolute-like paths (e.g. `/images/...`)
- Fix gallery/image persistence failures caused by unresolved screenshot paths

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Replace single-slot `pendingInput` with FIFO array queue to prevent message loss when multiple inputs arrive while the agent is busy
- Auto-interrupt the current agent turn when a new message is queued, so queued messages are picked up promptly instead of waiting for the turn to finish
- Add `queued` flag to `input_ack` response so the client can show a "queued" indicator
- Preserve queued messages across `interrupt()` calls instead of clearing them

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Server-side filtering for `list_recent_sessions`: `provider`, `namedOnly`, and `searchQuery` parameters
- Search matches against session name, first/last prompt, and summary

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- Recommend `npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest` to ensure users always run the latest version
- Updated launchd plist template, README, and in-app setup guide
